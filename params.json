Currently I am in the process of making a nice pretty completely made by me HTML 5 webpage, but until then this will have to do.  So please bear with me.\r\n\r\n## About Me\r\nI am a University of Waterloo student studying computer programming.  Ever since I started programming in grade nine I was hooked.  Something about being able to see a creation of mine come to life and do what I want I just find amazing.\r\n\r\n## Education\r\nI am enrolled at the University of Waterloo in Honours Mathematics, but will be switching to Computer Science soon.  I chose this path, because for the first 1.5 years they are identical courses, but math is half the price.  So I was always in it for the computers.  As part of my education thus far I have taken and completed Algebra, Linear Algebra, Calculus (parts one and two), and Computer Science (parts one and two).  I have also taken as electives both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics, Physics, and German.\r\n\r\n## Computer Programming Skills\r\n* Web Development\r\n  * HTML\r\n  * CSS\r\n  * JS\r\n* Server Side\r\n  * PHP\r\n* Scripting\r\n  * Python 2.7\r\n* Native Code\r\n  * C\r\n  * C++ -> I am in the process of learning this right now","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
